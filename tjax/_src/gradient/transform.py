    A gradient transformation transforms loss gradients (with respect to weights) into weight deltas
    that are added to the weights.  The typical goal of a gradient transformation is for the weights
    to converge quickly and stably.

    The most basic gradient transformation is the scaled negative gradients, which can be
    interpreted as doing Newton's method with an assumed isotropic loss Hessian.  In general, all
    gradient transformations can be interpreted as Hessian estimators.
